For best performance, I recommend setting `page_size=1` to download individual outputs, which will eliminate extra time needed to zip outputs and will ensure faster processing times per request. An example streaming request loop is available at the bottom of the tutorial below. **\n",

For now, let's select 10 granules to be processed in each zipped request. For ATL06, the granule size can exceed 100 MB so we want to choose a granule count that provides us with a reasonable zipped download size. "
