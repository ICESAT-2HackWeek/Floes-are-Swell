This is the overall directory containing project directories. The directory structure is as follows:

-----------------------
Floes-are-Swell/Scripts 
-----------------------
 --- download_data_general.ipynb : a jupyter notebook that shows how to download and segment granules from the NSIDC data portal. 
 --- readintoxr.py : a python script that reads ATL07 files into an xarray dataset
      -- readintoxr.MakeDataSet : reads in a single .h5 file and beam
      -- readintoxr.MultiFileDataSet : reads in several listed .h5 files and listed beams
 --- ice_plot.py : a set of scripts that make nice plots of the polar regions 
  
-----------------------
Floes-are-Swell/FSD 
-----------------------
 --- FSDutil.py : A python file with utility programs for reading in the Chord Length and Lead Width distributions
      -- FSDutil.get_CLD(beam_xarr) : takes a given xarray structure with a single index and computed the CLD using the field beam_xarr.isita_lead
      -- FSDutil.get_LWD(beam_xarr) : takes a given xarray structure with a single index and computed the LWD using the field beam_xarr.isita_lead
          NOTE: FSDutil.get_LWD returns +/- the same results as the ATl10 flag "lead_length", which is probably easier to use.
 
 --- FSD_single_track.ipynv : a notebook file that takes a single ATL07 file, reads in beams as necessary, and then spits out the CLD/LWD in nice plots
